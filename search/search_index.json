But \nwhy\n not just provide objects?\n\nHow do extensions work\n?\n\n\nWhy Extensions?\n\n\nExtensions are a way of packaging NAV functionality that was introduced in NAV\n2016. The major benefit is that they allow some functionality to be applied to a\ntarget database without impacting any existing development.\n\n\nNo Merging\n\n\nWith traditional object deployment, any changes to standard NAV objects must be\nmerged \u2013 either using PowerShell cmdlets or working with text files of objects\nmanually.\n\n\nWith extensions, you take the .navx file that we supply, use PowerShell to\npublish and install the extension into the database and leave NAV to worry about\nmerging the functionality of each object.\n\n\nUninstalling\n\n\nWhen some functionality is installed as an extension, removing that\nfunctionality is as easy as installing it. Removing code and table fields in\nyour customer\u2019s database is not without risk. If you need to remove the\nextension just run the Uninstall-NavApp cmdlet \u2013 the data will be safely\narchived and the functionality removed from the database.\n\n\nHow do Extensions Work?\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThere is thorough documentation on how extensions work and how to deploy them on\nMSDN: \nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt574417%28v=nav.90%29.aspx\n\n\nThe process to apply an extension to a database is simple:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the navx file to the NAV service tier machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a PowerShell ISE session as administrator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport the NAV PowerShell modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublish the extension to a service tier connected to the target database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the extension to the target service tier/tenant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynchronise the target tenant(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart any client sessions that were logged in prior to the installation to\n    see menu changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerShell\n\n\nOpen PowerShell ISE as administrator to start a new session. This session will\nallow us to import NAV modules and execute commands against the service tier to\npublish and install the extensions.\n\n\nModules\n\n\nNAV includes several PowerShell modules which allow you to work with the service\ntier, objects and extensions. Import these modules with the \nImport-Module\n\ncommand in PowerShell ISE as follows. Note: these are the default installation\npaths for NAV 2017, change as appropriate to your installation.\n\n\nImport-Module \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Dynamics\nNAV\\100\\Service\\Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Apps.Management.psd1\"\n\nImport-Module \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Dynamics\nNAV\\100\\Service\\Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Management.psm1\"\n\n\nNavApp Cmdlets\n\n\nThe Apps.Management module imported above contains the cmdlets necessary for\nworking with extensions.\n\n\nPublishing Extensions\n\n\nThe first step in applying an extension to a database is to \u2018publish\u2019 it. This\nprocess verifies that there is no development in the extension that is\nincompatible with the target database and makes the functionality available to\ninstall in the target database.\n\n\nThe cmdlet to use is \nPublish-NavApp\n, as follows:\n\n\nPublish-NavApp DynamicsNAV100 -Path \u201cC:\\Extensions\\Promotions.navx\u201d\n\n\nReplace \u2018DynamicsNAV100\u2019 with the name of the server instance you are targeting\nand the file path with the location of the navx file.\n\n\nInstalling Extensions\n\n\nOnce an extension has been published to a database it is available to install\ninto one or more of the tenants served by that database. The cmdletto use is\n\nInstall-NavApp,\n as follows:\n\n\nInstall-NavApp DynamicsNAV100 -Name \u2018Promotions\u2019 -Tenant \u2018TenantA\u2019\n\n\nReplace \u2018DynamicsNAV100\u2019 with the name of the server instance you are targeting,\n\u2018Promotions\u2019 with the name of the extension and \u2018TenantA\u2019 with the name of the\ntenant you wish to install the extension into. If your database contains only a\nsingle tenant the -Tenant switch can be omitted.\n\n\nYou can use the \nGet-NavAppInfo\n cmdlet to view details, including the name,\nversion and publisher of extensions that are published into the database.\n\n\nSynchronising the Tenant\n\n\nHaving published and installed the extension it is good practice to check that\nthe metadata of the tenant is in sync with the SQL database. Use the\n\nSync-NavTenant\n cmdlet:\n\n\nSync-NAVTenant DynamicsNAV100 -Tenant \u2018TenantA\u2019\n\n\nAgain, replace DynamicsNAV100 with the name of the server instance you are\ntargeting and \u2018TenantA\u2019 with the name of the tenant. The -Tenant switch can be\nomitted if the database contains only a single tenant.\n\n\nRemoving Extensions\n\n\nExtensions can easily be removed from a database by reversing the installation\nprocess.\n\n\nUninstall-NavApp DynamicsNAV100 -Name \u2018Promotions\u2019\n\nUnpublish-NavApp DynamicsNAV100 -Name \u2018Promotions\u2019\n\n\nReplace \u2018DynamicsNAV100\u2019 and \u2018Promotions\u2019 as appropriate. \nSynchronise the\ntenant\n afterwards.\n\n\nExtension Management\n\n\nExtensions can also be managed through the NAV client. Open the \u201cExtension\nManagement\u201d page to view available extensions, install and uninstall them. Note\nthat only published extensions are visible in this page. \nPowerShell must be\nused to publish an extension\n before the Extension\nManagement page can be used to install it.",
