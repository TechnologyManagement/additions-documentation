But \nwhy\n not just provide objects?\n\nHow do extensions work\n?\n\n\nWhy Extensions?\n\n\nExtensions are a way of packaging NAV functionality that was introduced in NAV\n2016. The major benefit is that they allow some functionality to be applied to a\ntarget database without impacting any existing development.\n\n\nNo Merging\n\n\nWith traditional object deployment, any changes to standard NAV objects must be\nmerged \u2013 either using PowerShell cmdlets or working with text files of objects\nmanually.\n\n\nWith extensions, you take the .navx file that we supply, use PowerShell to\npublish and install the extension into the database and leave NAV to worry about\nmerging the functionality of each object.\n\n\nUninstalling\n\n\nWhen some functionality is installed as an extension, removing that\nfunctionality is as easy as installing it. Removing code and table fields in\nyour customer\u2019s database is not without risk. If you need to remove the\nextension just run the Uninstall-NavApp cmdlet \u2013 the data will be safely\narchived and the functionality removed from the database.\n\n\nHow do Extensions Work?\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThere is thorough documentation on how extensions work and how to deploy them on\nMSDN: \nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt574417%28v=nav.90%29.aspx\n\n\nThe process to apply an extension to a database is simple:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the navx file to the NAV service tier machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a PowerShell ISE session as administrator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport the NAV PowerShell modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublish the extension to a service tier connected to the target database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the extension to the target service tier/tenant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynchronise the target tenant(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart any client sessions that were logged in prior to the installation to\n    see menu changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerShell\n\n\nOpen PowerShell ISE as administrator to start a new session. This session will\nallow us to import NAV modules and execute commands against the service tier to\npublish and install the extensions.\n\n\nModules\n\n\nNAV includes several PowerShell modules which allow you to work with the service\ntier, objects and extensions. Import these modules with the \nImport-Module\n\ncommand in PowerShell ISE as follows. Note: these are the default installation\npaths for NAV 2017, change as appropriate to your installation.\n\n\nImport-Module \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Dynamics\nNAV\\100\\Service\\Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Apps.Management.psd1\"\n\nImport-Module \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Dynamics\nNAV\\100\\Service\\Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Management.psm1\"\n\n\nNavApp Cmdlets\n\n\nThe Apps.Management module imported above contains the cmdlets necessary for\nworking with extensions.\n\n\nPublishing Extensions\n\n\nThe first step in applying an extension to a database is to \u2018publish\u2019 it. This\nprocess verifies that there is no development in the extension that is\nincompatible with the target database and makes the functionality available to\ninstall in the target database.\n\n\nThe cmdlet to use is \nPublish-NavApp\n, as follows:\n\n\nPublish-NavApp DynamicsNAV100 -Path \u201cC:\\Extensions\\Promotions.navx\u201d\n\n\nReplace \u2018DynamicsNAV100\u2019 with the name of the server instance you are targeting\nand the file path with the location of the navx file.\n\n\nInstalling Extensions\n\n\nOnce an extension has been published to a database it is available to install\ninto one or more of the tenants served by that database. The cmdletto use is\n\nInstall-NavApp,\n as follows:\n\n\nInstall-NavApp DynamicsNAV100 -Name \u2018Promotions\u2019 -Tenant \u2018TenantA\u2019\n\n\nReplace \u2018DynamicsNAV100\u2019 with the name of the server instance you are targeting,\n\u2018Promotions\u2019 with the name of the extension and \u2018TenantA\u2019 with the name of the\ntenant you wish to install the extension into. If your database contains only a\nsingle tenant the -Tenant switch can be omitted.\n\n\nYou can use the \nGet-NavAppInfo\n cmdlet to view details, including the name,\nversion and publisher of extensions that are published into the database.\n\n\nSynchronising the Tenant\n\n\nHaving published and installed the extension it is good practice to check that\nthe metadata of the tenant is in sync with the SQL database. Use the\n\nSync-NavTenant\n cmdlet:\n\n\nSync-NAVTenant DynamicsNAV100 -Tenant \u2018TenantA\u2019\n\n\nAgain, replace DynamicsNAV100 with the name of the server instance you are\ntargeting and \u2018TenantA\u2019 with the name of the tenant. The -Tenant switch can be\nomitted if the database contains only a single tenant.\n\n\nRemoving Extensions\n\n\nExtensions can easily be removed from a database by reversing the installation\nprocess.\n\n\nUninstall-NavApp DynamicsNAV100 -Name \u2018Promotions\u2019\n\nUnpublish-NavApp DynamicsNAV100 -Name \u2018Promotions\u2019\n\n\nReplace \u2018DynamicsNAV100\u2019 and \u2018Promotions\u2019 as appropriate. \nSynchronise the\ntenant\n afterwards.\n\n\nExtension Management\n\n\nExtensions can also be managed through the NAV client. Open the \u201cExtension\nManagement\u201d page to view available extensions, install and uninstall them. Note\nthat only published extensions are visible in this page. \nPowerShell must be\nused to publish an extension\n before the Extension\nManagement page can be used to install it.",

            "text": "SFDC Development Guide\n\n\nIntro\n\n\nThis document is for developers who wish to extend the functionality of the Shop\nFloor Data Capture addition from Technology Management.\n\n\nFunctionality should only be extended through subscription to integration events\nincluded in the product. No changes should be made to the SFDC objects\nthemselves.\n\n\nPage Customisation\n\n\nMost of the logic for defining the pages that are displayed in the web portal by\nSFDC is contained in the \u201cSFDC \u2013 Page Definition Mgt.\u201d codeunit.\n\n\nThis codeunit builds populates data in the following temporary tables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal Framework Control\n - each record defines a control (button, grid,\n    textbox, image etc.) that should be displayed on the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal Framework Control Data\n \u2013 data that is associated with a control\n    e.g. the data to be shown in cells of a grid control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortal Framework Control Metadata\n \u2013 the metadata associated with a\n    control, e.g. its type, colour, caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard SFDC logic will populate these tables with records to define each\npage in the portal. The following integration events provided opportunity to\noverride the standard logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnBeforeBuildPage\n \u2013 called before any of the standard\n    logic is applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnAfterBuildPage\n \u2013 called after the standard logic has\n    been applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnAddControlToPage\n \u2013 called immediately before each\n    control is \u2018added\u2019 to the page i.e. before each record is included in the\n    set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese events can be used to manipulate the data contained in these temporary\ntables, which in turn will reflect the controls that are built by the portal.\n\n\nOnBeforeBuildPage\n\n\nThis event is called before any of the standard logic for defining the page is\ncalled. The following parameters are included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivityCode \u2013 a code that denotes the type of activity for which a page\n    needs building e.g. DataSelection, OutputScreen, ComponentSubform \u2013 see the\n    \nxyz\nCode functions in the \u201cSFDC \u2013 Activity Mgt.\u201d codeunit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkApplicationDevice2 \u2013 a record denoting the current Portal Framework\n    Application device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataTypeCode \u2013 when the requested activity is DataSelection, this code\n    indicates the type of data that should be presented to the user for\n    selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table representing the set of\n    controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing data associated\n    with the controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkControlMetadata \u2013 the temporary table containing metadata\n    associated with the controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivityLogEntryNo \u2013 the entry no. of the log record associated with this\n    activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandled \u2013 a Boolean indicating whether the event has been handled (true\n    indicates that the standard logic should not be called).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnAfterBuildPage\n\n\nThis event is called after the standard SFDC logic has been applied. The same\nparameters are included as for \nOnBeforeBuildPage\n, except\nfor the Handled parameter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivityCode \u2013 a code that denotes the type of activity for which a page\n    needs building e.g. DataSelection, OutputScreen, ComponentSubform \u2013 see the\n    \nxyz\nCode functions in the \u201cSFDC \u2013 Activity Mgt.\u201d codeunit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkApplicationDevice2 \u2013 a record denoting the current Portal Framework\n    Application device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataTypeCode \u2013 when the requested activity is DataSelection, this code\n    indicates the type of data that should be presented to the user for\n    selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table representing the set of\n    controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing data associated\n    with the controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkControlMetadata \u2013 the temporary table containing metadata\n    associated with the controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivityLogEntryNo \u2013 the entry no. of the log record associated with this\n    activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnAddControlToPage\n\n\nThis event is called for each control that is included in the temporary tables\nthat is set by the standard logic. This gives the opportunity for the data\nassociated with the control to be manipulated, the control \u201cskipped\u201d i.e. not\nincluded on the page and \nnew controls to be injected before the current\ncontrol\n.\n\n\nThe following parameters are included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivityCode \u2013 a code that denotes the type of activity for which a page\n    needs building e.g. DataSelection, OutputScreen, ComponentSubform \u2013 see the\n    \nxyz\nCode functions in the \u201cSFDC \u2013 Activity Mgt.\u201d codeunit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkApplicationDevice2 \u2013 a record denoting the current Portal Framework\n    Application device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table representing the set of\n    controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing data associated\n    with the controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkControlMetadata \u2013 the temporary table containing metadata\n    associated with the controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkipControl \u2013 a Boolean indicating whether the control should be skipped. If\n    this is set to true the current control will not be included on the page\n    that is built by the portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Controls\n\n\nNew controls can be added though use of the functions on the\nPortalFrameworkControl parameter passed by the above integration events.\n\n\nThe following functions can be used to create new controls:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddNewEntry \u2013 creates a new control below the current one and moves the\n    pointer to the new control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddNewEntryBefore \u2013 creates a new control before the current one and moves\n    the pointer to the new control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese functions require a ControlID. This should be a unique code that is\nassociated with the control. This ID will be used in subsequent web service\ncalls to NAV when activity occurs that is associated with this control. See\n\nHandling Device Activity\n.\n\n\nMetadata\n\n\nHaving creating the control, metadata must be added to determine its type and\nappearance. Metadata records are added with the AddMetadata function. The\nfollowing parameters are required:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkControlMetadata \u2013 a Portal Framework Control Metadata record. This\n    will be populated with the appropriate values defined by the other\n    parameters and inserted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName \u2013 the name of the metadata. See \nMetadata Names and\n    Values\n for a list of valid metadata names and\n    values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType \u2013 the type of the metadata. This is an option: 0 = Element, 1 =\n    Attribute. The correct value for this parameter will be determined by the\n    metadata name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue \u2013 the value of the metadata. See \nMetadata Names and\n    Values\n for a list of valid metadata names and\n    values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use these functions to create a new control you will need to implement an\nevent subscriber to \nhandle the activity\n associated\nwith the control. For example, if you add a new button control you need to\nprovide a handler function for to determine the correct response to that button\nbeing clicked.\n\n\nMetadata Names and Values\n\n\nBelow is a list of the valid metadata names and their corresponding values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nType\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n\n\n0\n\n\nbutton, text, selectiontiles, selectionlist, image\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n0\n\n\nThe text of the caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\n\n\n0\n\n\nThe value to display in the control\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolour\n\n\n1\n\n\nAny value that is valid for HTML i.e. hex value, name of colour\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplacement\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2018right\u2019/\u2019left\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubform\n\n\n1\n\n\ntrue/false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlayout\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u2018nav\u2019/\u20191-column\u2019/\u20192-columns\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubforms\n\n\nLayouts\n\n\nHandling Device Activity\n\n\n\u2018Activity\u2019 refers to anything that happens in the web portal which results in a\ncall to the NAV web service. The context of the activity (the control that was\nused, the current state of the page) is passed to NAV and the portal expects a\nresponse containing the definition of the page that should be shown next.\n\n\nYou can use the following integration events in the \u201cSFDC \u2013 Post Mgt.\u201d codeunit\nto execute your code when \u2018activity\u2019 takes place on the portal.\n\n\nOnBeforeHandleActivity\n\n\nThis event is called before any standard logic is executed. You can use this\nevent to override the response to standard SFDC activity or define the response\nto your own controls. The event has the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table containing the controls on the\n    page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing the data\n    associated with the controls on the page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkApplicationDevice \u2013 a record indicating the device that the\n    activity came from\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivityCode \u2013 a code denoting the type of activity that has occurred i.e.\n    the code corresponding to the portal page that the activity took place in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand \u2013 a code denoting the control on the above page that raised the\n    activity. This code corresponds to the ControlID assigned to the control by\n    the Page Definition codeunit. See \nAdding Controls\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkActivityLog \u2013 the activity log record associated with this\n    activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandled \u2013 a Boolean indicating whether this activity has been handled. A\n    value of true will bypass any standard logic that would apply to this\n    activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnAfterDeviceActivity\n\n\nThis event is raised after any standard logic has been applied in response to\nthe activity. It has the same parameter as OnBeforeDeviceActivity except for the\nHandled parameter, which is omitted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the temporary table containing the controls on the\n    page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 the temporary table containing the data\n    associated with the controls on the page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkApplicationDevice \u2013 a record indicating the device that the\n    activity came from\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivityCode \u2013 a code denoting the type of activity that has occurred i.e.\n    the code corresponding to the portal page that the activity took place in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand \u2013 a code denoting the control on the above page that raised the\n    activity. This code corresponds to the ControlID assigned to the control by\n    the Page Definition codeunit. See \nAdding Controls\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkActivityLog \u2013 the activity log record associated with this\n    activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction Groups\n\n\nSFDC can be customised with the concept of \u201cProduction Groups\u201d. This provides a\nway of grouping prod. order lines that need to be worked on together other than\nby the prod. order no.\n\n\nThe user will be presented with a list of production groups to select from,\nrather than a list of prod. orders / prod. order routing lines.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nSFDC can be configured to use production groups globally i.e. all machine\ncentres are assigned work by production groups, by including the PROD_GROUP data\ntype in one of the three data selection fields on the SFDC Setup page.\n\n\nAlternatively, if some machine centres work with production groups, but not all,\nthe \u201cUse Production Groups\u201d field can be set on the SFDC tab of the Machine\nCentre card.\n\n\nNote:\n in the Process Type must be set to All Lines (rather than Single\nLines) for Machine Centres that use production groups.\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\nThe standard SFDC product has no definition of what a production group is, or\nthe lines that it contains. This definition must be supplied by event\nsubscriptions in custom code in the project.\n\n\nTwo key pieces of information are required by SFDC at various points during the\nworkflow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the valid production groups that the user can select from?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich prod. order routing line(s) are included in each production group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese questions are answered by subscribing to the following events:\n\n\nCOD9059236. OnBuildProdGroupSelectionBuffer\n\n\nThis event is used to define the valid production group(s) that the user can\nselect. This event should be subscribed to in a custom codeunit. The parameters\nto the function are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkApplicationDevice \u2013 the record corresponding to the device that has\n    made the call to the Portal Framework Web Service.\n\n\n\n\nThis can be used to determine extra information about the call e.g. the\n    Machine Centre or Operators that have been selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControl \u2013 the selection list representing the list of\n    production groups that will be presented to the user.\n\n\n\n\nThis record should be populated with the appropriate row/column data to\n    show to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControlData \u2013 this record represents the collection of\n    row/column data that has been populated from the production groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandled \u2013 a Boolean that should be set to true to indicate that this event\n    has been handled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nIn this example a bespoke field has been added to the Prod. Order Line table to\nindicate which production group each line belongs to. This code loops through\nthe prod. order lines to determine the distinct set of production groups related\nto the Machine Centre that the user has already selected.\n\n\nNote:\n the first row of data added to PortalFrameworkControl will be used as\nthe headings for the selection list that is presented to the user.\n\n\nSFDCManagement.GetDeviceMachineCenter(PortalFwkApplicationDevice,MachineCenter);\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControl.AddData(PortalFrameworkControlData,1,1,'Code',FALSE);\n\n\nPortalFrameworkControl.AddData(PortalFrameworkControlData,1,2,'Description',FALSE);\n\n\nRowNo := 1;\n\n\nProdOrderLine.SETCURRENTKEY(\"Production Group Code\");\n\n\nProdOrderLine.SETFILTER(\"Production Group Code\",'>%1','');\n\n\nIF ProdOrderLine.FINDSET THEN\n\n\nREPEAT\n\n\nProdOrderRoutingLine.SETRANGE(Status,ProdOrderLine.Status);\n\n\nProdOrderRoutingLine.SETRANGE(\"Prod.

It will be called several times as the\nuser navigates around the SFDC portal to display details appropriate to the\nselected production group.\n\n\nThe event has the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortalFwkApplicationDevice - the record corresponding to the device that has\n    made the call to the Portal Framework Web Service.\n\n\n\n\nThis can be used to determine extra information about the call e.g. the\n    Machine Centre or Operators that have been selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProdGroup \u2013 the production group which has been selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProdOrderRoutingLine \u2013 a record where the lines related to the production\n    group should be MARKed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandled \u2013 a Boolean to indicate that this event has been handled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nAs above, a bespoke field has been added to the prod. order line to indicate\nwhich production group they belong to. The prod. order lines belonging to the\nproduction group are iterated through and those lines which have a prod. order\nrouting line for the current Machine Centre, with a quantity available to start,\nare MARKed.\n\n\nSFDCManagement.GetDeviceMachineCenter(PortalFwkApplicationDevice,MachineCenter);\n\n\nProdOrderLine.SETRANGE(\"Production Group Code\",ProdGroup);\n\n\nIF ProdOrderLine.FINDSET THEN\n\n\nREPEAT\n\n\nProdOrderRoutingLine.SETRANGE(Status,ProdOrderLine.Status);\n\n\nProdOrderRoutingLine.SETRANGE(\"Prod.

The standard application allows the user\nto upload a PDF document against a Routing Line record.\n\n\nWhen this routing line record is inherited by a released production order the\nuser will see an \u201cInstruction\u201d button in the navigation pane in the SFDC portal.\nClicking this button will display the PDF content in the portal window.\n\n\nThis functionality can be overridden by subscribing to the follow events: ###\nCOD9059234.OnBeforeProdOrderRtngLineHasInstruction This event allows a custom\nsubscriber to indicate if the prod. order routing line has an instruction. This\nis used to determine whether to display the \u201cInstruction\u201d button on the output\nscreen. The event has the following parameters: - ProdOrderRtingLine - This\nmight be a set of record if the machine center is an All Line process type -\nHasInstruction \u2013 set the Boolean if there is an instruction available - Handled\n\u2013 a Boolean to indicate that this event has been handled.\n\n\nCOD9059234.OnBeforeGetProdOrderRtingLineResource\n\n\nThis event can be used to set the resource that will be displayed on the\ninstruction page. The event has the following parameters: - ProdOrderRtingLine \u2013\nsingle record in question for resource - ResourceValue \u2013 resource identifier\npath, should be unique for each file. - i.e. the value consist of an identifier\ndirectory and a file name with the primary keys of the record which the resource\nis set against. - ResourceFileExtension \u2013 the file extension of resource file -\nHandled \u2013 a Boolean to indicate that this event has been handled.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nSetting the resource from a sales order after getting the sales header of the\nProdOrderRtingLine\n\n\nResourceValue :=\nSTRSUBSTNO('%1/%2_%3',SalesOrderInstructionDirectoryName,SalesHeader.\"Document\nType\",SalesHeader.\"No.\");\n\n\nResourceFileExtension := 'pdf';\n\n\nHandled := TRUE;\n\n\n*SalesOrderInstructionDirectoryName is a function that returns\n\u2018/SFDC/SalesOrder/Instruction\u2019\n\n\nCOD9059234.OnBuildPortalResourceResponse\n\n\nThis event can be used to return the resource file content.

This screen can\nbe found through the Search functionality or through the Departments Menu\n(Departments -> Shop Floor Data Capture -> Setup -> SFDC Setup).\n\n\n\n\nGeneral FastTab\n\n\nThe General FastTab needs to be filled in with the Portal Framework Application\nID which we covered the creation of in the \nprevious\nsection.\n\n\nData Selection FastTab\n\n\nIncludes the \nData Selection fields\n, these should be filled with data types\nthat have been setup within the \nPortal Framework Data Types\nsetup.\n These Data Types are selected from within the\nSFDC Screens, with the setup I have above operators would firstly need to select\ntheir machine center if there wasn\u2019t a pre-selected default, then their operator\ncode and finally which Production Order they were working on. it is important to\nnote that each of the values within these fields needs to be unique. Also, each\nmust be filled sequentially, meaning that Data Selection 2 cannot be filled in\nunless Data Selection 1 is and so on.\n\n\nAlso, here is the \nShow Ops with no Qty Start\n which is used to determine\nwhether only operations with a quantity to start are shown or whether they are\nshown regardless of whether they have a quantity to start or not.\n\n\nNext is the \nShow Prod. Order from Work Center\n which if ticked will show lines\nthat are assigned to both the current machine center and its parent work center.\nThe decision to tick this will depend on business process, as if there are\nproduction planning processes that determine which production orders are\ncompleted on which machines in advance then it may not be required for SFDC to\ndisplay the production order lines for the parent work center.\n\n\nFinally, for this FastTab is \nExclude Ops from Other Devices,\n this will filter\nout operations selected on other devices from the selection screen.\n\n\n\n\nOutput Screen FastTab\n\n\nThe \nAllow Scrap\n Tick box determines whether to display the Scrap button. The\n\nAllow By-Products\n tick box is used for components that can then be re-used,\nsuch as metal that can be melted down and used again.\n\n\nAllow Device Switching\n \u2013 This should be ticked if the Device is not going to\nonly be on one machine as this allows for the device to be switched to another\nmachine or work center by the Operator. We will discuss this in more detail\nlater in Switching Device.\n\n\nTicking \nPost Output During Setup Time\n allows for output to be posted during\nsetup time.\n\n\nThe \nLot Track Output,\n when ticked, identifies if there is an item tracking\nline for the production order line, if there is this will be displayed on the\noutput screen. The Lot Track Consumption tick box is used to determine the lot\nnumber for a component, this is done through the selection of Lot Info. All\nconsumption made for this component is then taken from that lot number until it\nis changed within NAV.\n\n\nComponent Lot Handling\n \u2013 This field should have the options of (blank),\nPopulate when Single Lot or Split by Lot\n\n\n\n\nA non-blank value can only be selected when \"Lot Track Consumption\" is ticked\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlank Option- will work as per the existing functionality i.e. showing a Lot\n    No. column for the user to populate with the appropriate lot manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulate when Single Lot Option- indicates that the system should\n    automatically populate the Lot No. column for a component line when there is\n    a single item tracking line already existing against the prod. order\n    component and therefore we are expecting to consume all stock from a single\n    lot no.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit by Lot Option - If there are already some item tracking lines against\n    a prod. order component it should be possible to split the component lines\n    shown on the portal by each combination of component line no. and lot no. In\n    this case populate the Lot No. column and the Quantity column with the lot\n    numbers and the (sum) quantity that has been assigned to that lot in the\n    item tracking lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will give the user a clear way to indicate which lot numbers they are\nconsuming when that information is required by the component item.\n\n\nThis behaviour should be optional by a new setting on the SFDC Setup page. Some\ncustomers may want their users to confirm the lot number manually even if there\nare item tracking lines already assigned to the prod. order component.\n\n\nOperators FastTab\n\n\nSelecting \nShow No. of Expected Operators\n allows for a different number of\nexpected operators in the setup and runtime elements of the operation.\n\n\nTicking the \nPost Operator Dimensions\n allows for operator dimensions to be\nposted with the device capacity entries.\n\n\nSFDC Operators have a cost defined on the \nSFDC Operators\n screen which is\ncovered later. The \nPost Operator Time/Cost\n calculates the time that the\noperator works on a production order with the Operator Cost and store this on\nthe SFDC Device Log Table.\n\n\nTicking \nAllow users to Add Notes\n means that notes can be added within SFDC,\nnot just within NAV.\n\n\n\n\nStop Codes FastTab\n\n\nThe creation of \nStop Codes\n is covered in more detail later, here Stop Codes\nneed to be assigned to each of the stages specified. Each of the codes specified\nhere need to be planned stops due to the nature of the stages.\n\n\nDevice Status Colour FastTab\n\n\nThe Output screen can be configured to have a different background colour\ndepending upon the status of the device. It is within the Device Status Colours\nthat these numbers can be specified. These colours help those walking around the\nshop floor to easily identify the status of the machine and attracts attention\nto those that are on an unplanned stop.\n\n\nOnce setup is complete the final step is to run the Calculate Quantity Available\nto Start, this initialises the Quantity Available to Start on the Production\nOrder Routing Line Table. The SFDC screens can be accessed from this point\n\n\n\n\nSFDC Operators\n\n\nOperators are those working at a given work/machine center on a given production\norder and will need to be setup to use SFDC functionality. This setup can be\nfound through the Search functionality or through the Departments Menu\n(Departments -> Shop Floor Data Capture -> Setup)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n - Each Operator must have a unique code, this is used for posting the\nwork they have completed.\n\n\nName\n \u2013 Each operator is given a name, this is the field that will appear on\nthe SFDC portal when selecting an operator.\n\n\nMachine Center No\n. \u2013 This field is the machine center in which the capacity\nledger entries will be posted to if populated.\n\n\nUnit of measure\n \u2013 this is the posting unit of measure against Capacity\nLedger Entries, in this example we are using minutes.\n\n\nUnit Cost\n \u2013 The operators cost per unit of measure again for posting\nCapacity Ledger Entries this allows for the calculating of the cost of this\noperator working on the machine\n\n\nBy highlighting a line within Operators and selecting SFDC Operator Centers,\nthese workers can be made exclusively available to a Work Center Group, Work\nCenter and Machine Center.\n\n\n\n\nOperator Dimensions\n\n\nA dimension for the Operators should also be added to aid in the reporting of\nSFDC.\n\n\nThe first step is to add an Operator Dimension to the Dimensions List. This can\nbe accessed using the search functionality or through the Departments Menu\n(Departments -> Financial Management -> Setup -> Dimensions).\n\n\nThe Dimension needs to include a Code, Name, Code Caption and Filter Caption as\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\nOnce these fields have been completed go to the SFDC Setup Screen and select the\nOperator Dimensions Action from the Ribbon.\n\n\n\n\nFrom here the SFDC Operator Dimensions will open, up to 4 Operator Numbers can\nbe added alongside the Dimension Code.\n\n\nMachine Center Setup\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the SFDC install an additional FastTab is added to the Machine\nCenters screen.\n\n\nThe first field to select is for \nProd. Order Presentation\n, selecting prompt\nwill allow the operator to choose from a list of available production orders for\nthis machine center. On the other hand, selecting automatic will give the\noperator the next Production Order on the list, taking away the choice.\n\n\nThe next field to select is the \nProcess Type\n, selecting All Lines here will be\nsuitable for machine centers that are used for multiple production orders that\nare worked on simultaneously. Selecting Single Line will mean that each\nproduction order line will need to be selected in isolation with the machine\nstopped and started again each time.\n\n\nIf Multiple Lines has been selected within Process Type, the \nConsolidate\nComponents\n field can be ticked. Ticking this field will make the Components\nscreen on SFDC appear slightly differently by retrieving the components for all\nproduction order lines being worked on simultaneously but will only show each\nunique item/variant code once.\n\n\nNext is the \nSplit-Post Consolidate Components\n, this gives the option to split\nand post entries that are being stored on the SFDC Consumptions Entry Table. The\nQuantity to Post on a \nConsolidate Components\n screen should be split\nproportionally between the production order lines.\n\n\nThe Show in SFDC tick box needs to be selected for this machine center to show\nwithin SFDC.\n\n\nConfirm Operator on Output,\n if ticked a Subform will appear with SFDC with\ntiles of the operators currently assigned to the prod. order routing line. They\nwill then be prompted to select the operator who has worked on the output.\n\n\nThe \nShow Prod. Order from Work Ctr.\n will override the selection made within\nthe SFDC Setup screen and will show lines that are assigned to both the current\nmachine center and its parent work center.\n\n\nFinally, the \nUse Production Groups\n may be that certain machine centres do not\nwork on either a single prod. order routing line or a group of prod. order\nrouting lines that all belong to the same prod. order. These scenarios are\nalready supported.\n\n\nInstead, it may be the case that a machine works on a group of lines that is\ngrouped by something other than the prod. order no. Depending on the\nmanufacturing process it may be sensible to put lines from different prod.\norders into the machine / conveyor belt together.\n\n\nFor specified Machine Centers, the user should be able to select the production\ngroup to work on rather than prod. order.",

Ticking this field will make the Components\nscreen on SFDC appear slightly differently by retrieving the components for all\nproduction order lines being worked on simultaneously but will only show each\nunique item/variant code once.
