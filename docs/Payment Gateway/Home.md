Payment Gateway from Technology Management is used to take online card payments
through Payment Providers such as SagePay, WorldPay and WorldPay Hosted. The
advantage is that payments are taken through the provider and no card details
are taken within Dynamics NAV. These payments can then be automatically matched
up with and applied in Dynamics NAV against the Posted Invoice(s) that were
generated from the Sales Order.
